<h2>Info</h2>
<p>This UI was made by the Sigma-Chi/Calamari team, I just ported it to work as an Electron app with Script-Ware M. The UI was retrieved thanks to the wonderful Script-Ware community; individuals voluntarily sent us cached WebKit files found on their personal Mac devices for the purpose of preserving the legacy of Calamari. Some of these cached files are over a year old!<br><br>Thanks to mattt, Server_Noob, -ish, nzx, trill, Hailcut, phill, night, theLMGN, Inspect, AzuLX, Moon, cook, Cammy, Sigma, deima, doot, as well as many others for making this possible!</p>

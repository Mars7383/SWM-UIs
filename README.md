<h1>SWM UIs</h1>
Custom UIs for Script-Ware M. These UIs are small projects that I put together in a couple of days and likely won't be maintained (unlike <a href="https://github.com/Mars7383/Cali-Ware-UI">Cali-Ware UI</a>).

I've also made a UI Loader program which lets you drag in .swmui.asar files to load. You can use this if you hate downloading several 200mb+ electron apps, but it's quite buggy.
